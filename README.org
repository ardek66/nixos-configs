* NixOS configs
My current nixos config, as a flake. Messy as fuck, but you might find something interesting here.

To be used with [[https://github.com/ardek66/dotfiles.nix]], which is a module for home-manager that handles dotfiles outside of =home.nix=.

* Note
If you use =dotfiles.nix=, for updated dotfiles to take effect you must rebuild the system as follows:
#+begin_src bash
  nixos-rebuild switch --update-input dotfiles
#+end_src
